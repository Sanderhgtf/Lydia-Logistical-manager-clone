# Order Picking System

## Overview

The Order Picking System is designed to replicate the functionality of the Lydia Voice Control System commonly used in large distribution centers. It facilitates the efficient handling of logistics by providing features for saving, editing, and retrieving ticket data.

## Current Functionality

The current version of the Order Picking System includes the following features:

- **Ticket Booking:** Allows users to book tickets by specifying store ID, product ID, and product amount.

- **Ticket Viewing:** Enables users to view booked tickets based on store ID, with options to sort the results by various columns.

## How to Use

1. **Ticket Booking:**
    - Open `ticket_booker.php` in a web browser.
    - Fill in the required information (Store ID, Product ID, Product Amount) and submit the form.
    - The data will be stored in the database.

2. **Ticket Viewing:**
    - Open `ticket_viewer_form.html` in a web browser.
    - Specify the Store ID and choose sorting options (Column and Order).
    - Click "View Tickets" to see the booked tickets based on the specified criteria.

## Future Enhancements

The future development of the Order Picking System aims to achieve the following:

- **User Authentication:** Implement a secure login system to control access and ensure data privacy.

- **Ticket Editing:** Allow users to edit booked tickets, update product amounts, or modify other relevant information.

- **Advanced Sorting and Filtering:** Enhance the ticket viewing functionality with advanced sorting and filtering options to provide users with more flexibility.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Improve the overall user interface for a more intuitive and pleasant user experience.

- **Integration with External Systems:** Explore options for integrating the Order Picking System with other logistics or inventory management systems.
